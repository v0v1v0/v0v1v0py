<h2>Pressure and High Cloud Cover Spatially Distributed Time Series</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Six years of monthly pressure and high cloud cover measurements over a regular
grid of the Americas, from NASA's poster competition at the 2006 Joint Statistical Meeting (JSM).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(nasa)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>This NASA data set is stored as a list
of 3 components: <code>data</code> (containing the pressure and high cloud cover measurements),
<code>elev</code> (the elevation data), and <code>coast</code> (the coastline data).  To see the structure, type
<code>str(nasa)</code>, and see <code>Details</code> and <code>Source</code> for more information, below.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data are a subset of some geographic and atmospheric measurements on a coarse 24 by 24 grid covering Central America. The variables included are elevation, air pressure, and high cloud cover. With the exception of elevation, the variables are monthly averages, with observations for Jan., 1995 to Dec., 2000. These data were obtained from the NASA Langley Research Center Atmospheric Sciences Data Center.

<h2>Yes No with Variable Responses</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Asks a custom yes-no question with randomly varying responses.
Returns a flag indicating whether the user answered yes or no.
It is designed to be used in situations where the users needs to confirm
an affirmative action.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">yesno(...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Objects to paste and then output to produce the question.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The objects are first pasted without separators
and collapsed using <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠[paste0](..., collapse = "")⁠</code>
before being output using <code>cat()</code>.
</p>
<p>The order and phrasing of the possible responses varies randomly to ensure
the user consciously chooses
(as opposed to automatically types their response).
</p>
<p>A total of three responses are offered - two of which correspond to No and
one of which corresponds to Yes.
The possible responses are skewed to No to reduce the chances that
a blindly-typing
user mistakenly chooses an affirmative action.
For the same reason, selection of uncertain responses such as
'Uhhh... Maybe?'
is considered to be a No.
Selection of a 0 (to exit) is also considered to be No.
Questions should be phrased accordingly.
</p>

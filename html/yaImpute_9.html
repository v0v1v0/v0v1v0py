<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Imputation as it is defined in <code>yaImpute</code> can yield biased
results. Lets say that you have a collection of reference
observations that happen to be selected in a non-biased way among a
population. In this discussion, <em>population</em> is a finite set of all
individual sample units of interest; the reference plus target observations
often represent this population (but this need not be true, see below). 
If the average of a measured attribute is computed from
this random sample, it is an unbiased estimate of the true mean. 
<br><br>  
Using <code>yai</code>, while setting <em>k=1</em>, values for each of several
attributes are imputed from a single reference observation to a target
observation. Once the imputation is done over all the target observations, an
average of any one measured attribute can be computed over all the observations 
in the population. There is no guarantee that this average will be within a 
pre-specified confidence interval.
<br><br>
Experience shows that despite any lack of guarantee, the results are accurate 
(not biased). This tends to hold true when the reference data contains
samples that cover the variation of the targets, even when they are not a
random sample, and even if some of the reference observations are from sample
units that are outside the target population. 
<br><br>
Because there is no guarantee, and because the reference observations might
profitably come from sample units beyond those in the population 
(so as to insure all kinds of targets have a matching reference), it is necessary 
to test the imputation results for bias. If bias is found, it would be helpful to 
do something to correct it.
<br><br>
The <code>correctBias()</code> function is designed to check for, and correct
discovered bias by selecting alternative nearby reference observations 
to be imputed to targets that contribute to the bias. The idea is that even if
one reference is closest to a target, its attribute(s) of interest might 
be greater (or less) than the mean. An alternative neighbor, one that may be
almost as close, might reduce the overall bias if it were used instead. If this is
the case, <code>correctBias()</code> switches the neighbor selections. 
It makes as many switches as it can until the mean among the population 
targets falls within the specified confidence interval. 
There is no guarantee that the goal will be met.
<br><br>
The details of the method are: 
<br><br>
1. An attribute of interest is established by naming one in the call with
argument <code>tarVal</code>. Note that this can be a simple variable name enclosed
in quotations marks or it can be an <code>expression</code> of one or more variables. 
If the former, it is converted into an expression that is executed in the 
environment of the <code>reference</code> observations (both the X- and Y-variables). 
A confidence interval is computed for this value under the assumption that the 
reference observations are an unbiased sample of the target population. This may 
not be the case. Regardless, a confidence interval is <em>necessary</em> and it can
alternatively be supplied using <code>trgValCI</code>. 
<br><br>
2. One of several possible passes through the data are taken to find neighbor switches
that will result in the bias being corrected. A pass includes computing the
attribute of interest by applying the <code>expression</code> to values imputed to all 
the targets, under the assumption that the next neighbor is used 
in place of the currently used neighbor. This computation results in a 
vector with one element for each target observation that 
measures the contribution toward reducing the bias that would be made if 
a switch were made. The target observations are then ordered 
into increasing order of how much the distance from the currently selected 
reference would increase if the switch were to take place. Enough switches are 
made in this order to correct the bias. 
If the bias is not corrected by the first pass, another pass is done 
using the next neighbor(s).
The number of possible passes is equal to <em>k-1</em> where <em>k</em> is
set in the original call to <code>yai</code>. Note that switches are made
among targets only, and never among reference observations that may make up the
population. That is, reference observations are always left 
to represent themselves with <code>k=1</code>.   
<br><br>
3. Here are details of the argument <code>excludeRefIds</code>. When computing the mean
of the attribute of interest (using the <code>expression</code>), 
<code>correctBias()</code> must know which observations represent the
population. Normally, all the target observations would be in this set, but perhaps
not all of the reference observations. When <code>excludeRefIds</code> 
is left NULL, the population is made of all reference and all
target observations. Reference observations that should be left out
of the calculations because they are not part of the population can be specified
using the <code>excludeRefIds</code> argument as a vector of character strings identifying 
the rownames to leave out, or a vector of row numbers that identify the row numbers to 
leave out. If <code>excludeRefIds="all"</code>, all reference observations are excluded.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>yai</code> where <code>k = 1</code> and the neighbor selections
have been changed as described above. In addition, the <code>call</code> element is changed
to show both the original call to <code>yai</code> and the call to this function. 
A new list called <code>biasParameters</code> is added to the <code>yai</code> object  
with these tags:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>trgValCI</code></td>
<td>
<p>the target CI.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>curVal</code></td>
<td>
<p>the value of the bias that was achieved.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>npasses</code></td>
<td>
<p>the number of passes through the data taken to achieve the result.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>oldk</code></td>
<td>
<p>the old value of <code>k</code>.</p>

<h2>yamlet: Versatile Curation of Table Metadata</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <span class="pkg">yamlet</span> package supports storage and retrieval of table
metadata in yaml format.  The most important function
is <code>decorate.character</code>: it lets you 'decorate'
your data by attaching attributes retrieved from a file in
yaml format.  Typically your data will be of class
'data.frame', but it could be anything that is essentially
a named list.
</p>


<h3>Storage Format</h3>

<p>Storage format for 'yamlet' is a text file containing
well-formed yaml.  Technically, it is a map of sequences.
Though well formed, it need not be complete: attributes
or their names may be missing.
</p>
<p>In the simplest case, the data specification consists
of a list of column (item) names, followed by semicolons.
Perhaps you only have one column:
</p>
<p><code>mpg:</code>
</p>
<p>or maybe several:
</p>
<pre>
mpg:
cyl:
disp:
</pre>
<p>If you know descriptive labels for your columns, provide them
(skip a space after the colon).
</p>
<pre>
mpg: fuel economy
cyl: number of cylinders
disp: displacement
</pre>
<p>If you know units, create a sequence with square brackets.
</p>
<pre>
mpg: [ fuel economy, miles/gallon ]
cyl: number of cylinders
disp: [ displacement , in^3 ]
</pre>
<p>If you are going to give units, you probably should give a
key first, since the first anonymous element is 'label'
by default, and the second is 'guide'.  (A guide can be
units for numeric variables, factor levels/labels for
categorical variables, or a format string for dates, times,
and datetimes.)  You could give just the units
but you would have to be specific:
</p>
<p><code>mpg: [units: miles/gallon]</code>
</p>
<p>You can over-ride default keys by providing them in your data:
</p>
<pre>
mpg: [units: miles/gallon]
_keys: [label, units]
</pre>
<p>Notice that stored yamlet can be informationally defective
while syntactically correct. If you don't know an item
key at the time of data authoring, you can omit it:
</p>
<p><code>race: [race, [white: 0, black: 1, 2, asian: 3 ]]</code>
</p>
<p>Or perhaps you know the key but not the value:
</p>
<p><code>race: [race, [white: 0, black: 1, asian: 2, ? other ]]</code>
</p>
<p>Notice that <code>race</code> is factor-like; the factor sequence
is nested within the attribute sequence. Equivalently:
</p>
<p><code>race: [label: race, guide: [white: 0, black: 1, asian: 2, ? other ]]</code>
</p>
<p>If you have a codelist of length one, you should still enclose it in brackets:
</p>
<p><code>sex: [Sex, [ M ]]</code>
</p>
<p>To get started using yamlet, see <code>?as_yamlet.character</code> and
examples there. See also <code>?decorate</code> which adds yamlet
values to corresponding items in your data. See also <code>?print.decorated</code>
which uses label attributes, if present, as axis labels.
</p>
<p>Note: the quinidine and phenobarb datasets in the examples
are borrowed from <span class="pkg">nlme</span> (<code>?Quinidine</code>, <code>?Phenobarb</code>),
with some reorganization.
